      "input_text": "Florida Senators, The Electoral College is an unfair process. With multiple presidents winning the popular vote and losing their presidency, it is undemocratic. Myself, along with many other people across the state, believe that elections should be based on popular vote rather than the decisions of 538 electors. Although the Electoral College has its advantages, I believe that a majority vote by the people of the United States would be more accurate as well as fair.\n\nThe Electoral College is a winnertakesall system, meaning that candidates spend lots of time campaigning in the \"swing\" states rather than others. In 2000, seventeen states didn't even get to see the candidates. This means that almost 34% of voters didn't get a real feel for who they will be casting their votes for. Even though presidents should focus their time on big states with larger populations, it is unfair to the smaller states who don't get any visits from their candidates.\n\nWith the Electoral College system, voters vote for a slate of electors, rather than the presidents themselves. This means that when you cast your vote for Barack Obama ,for example, you are not voting for him. you are actually voting for a certain number of electors who contribute to the candidate's electoral votes. Electors can be anyone not in public office and they are usually chosen by the state. This is a corrupt system because the electors could be anyone, and change their ideas to not reflect the views of the people. In 1960, Louisiana legislature segregationists almost replaced all of the Democratic electors electors with new Kennedyopposing electors. The errors and problems in this system could be much greater, and government officials must be monitoring it at all times.\n\nIn the event of an Electoral College tie, the president election decision would be given to the House of Representatives, and the vicepresident decision to the Senate. This doesn't seem too terribly bad, but one representative from Wyoming would be representing 500,000 voters, and would have as much say as the 55 representatives representing 35 million people inhabiting California. This is not fair because of the widespread views of people in each state. There cannot be one candidate that the whole state agrees on, as people's ideas differ across the states.\n\nThere are many reasons to keep, as well as dispose of the Electoral College. The negatives outweigh the positives and a popular vote would be more democratic. We are supposed to be a democracy, and democracies thrive on the views of the people instead of electors.",

      "input_text": "Have you ever walked outside and taken a deep breath of fresh air but then you realise that the air your breathing isnt alll that fresh? Thats because air pollution has greatly increased in recent years and the number one reason for air pollution is the exhaust from your cars. Yes, the amount of cars in the world has increased dramtically in the last 10 years. While this is good that the luxury of owning an auto mobile it has also put a burden on the earth and future generations. while cars have made it easier for our day to day lives the amount of pollution in the world has become too high to not do something about it now. instead of taking the modern convenience of a car what if you decided to ride your bike to work for a change.\n\nThe fact that the amount of pollution is ever increasing should be enough of a reason to limit car usage. Instead of driving every time you go somewhere if you just rode a bike or walked when its convenient you could make a difference in the world. You dont have to completely stop driving your car but just limit the amount of times you do drive and that little extra effort will make a big difference in the long run. the world is facing an epidemic in which we could not have clean air for our future generations to be able to take their kids to the park and enjoy a nice day in the sun.\n\nNot only is limiting your car usage better for the environment it is also better for your body. When you decide to ride your bike or walk opposed to driving your car you are getting a work out from doing so. This may not seem like much but when you look at how often you go places the numbers start to add up. In the ten minutes that you would take to go to the bank you could spend fifteen minutes riding your bike and getting exercise multiple times through out the day. thiss can also give you much more free time to do something physically active that you ignored because of a car, with the motivation to go out pollution free you can start up running or even learn how to skate and enjoy the go.\n\nWhen you decide to make the change and not drive as much you open up endless possibilities for what you could do instead of sitting in one place driving. You become more active in the community and this helps the environment and you as a person. limited driving has been proved to be a great idea in more ways than you would think. Just doing your part can help out.\n\nIn conclusion the facts are all here that limited car usage is the best way to go for decreasing air pollution and making you a better you. It will help the future become a brighter and cleaner place to live.",
